1) **Learn Colour Harmony Strategies**  
   ○ Explore definitions and examples of different colour harmony strategies.  
   ○ Each strategy is explained with a chart and colour wheel illustration.  

2) **Upload Your Visualisation**  
   ○ Use the uploader to provide one or more images of your data visualisation.  
   ○ You can add as many images as needed and click **See the Verdict** to view all results at once.  
   ○ *Note*: For best results, upload images sized **150 × 150 pixels**.  

3) **See Verdict**  
   ○ The model analyses your visualisation and provides a verdict:  
      ▪ Inclusive for both genders  
      ▪ Inclusive for male  
      ▪ Not inclusive for both genders  
   ○ You’ll also see a confidence score explaining how certain the model is.  

4) **Improvement Suggestions**  
   ○ If your visualisation is not fully inclusive, you’ll get tailored improvement strategies.  
   ○ Example images are shown to help you apply these strategies.  

5) **Model Evaluation (Optional)**  
   ○ Expand the evaluation section to see accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.  
   ○ This helps you understand how robust the model is.

        ### What Does “Evaluation” Mean?
        Evaluation is like a reality check for the model.  
        We test it using a **held‑out test set** — data that was not used during training — to measure how well the model has learned to generalise.

        Why Test the Model’s Reliability?  
        Evaluating the model on this unseen test set helps you understand three key aspects:  
        **Accuracy** shows how often the model predicts correctly.  
        **Generalisation** indicates whether the model performs well on data it has never seen before.  
        **Error patterns** reveal which classes the model most often confuses.

        This matters because a model that performs well only on training data may not be trustworthy in practice.  
        By examining performance on the test set, you can see whether the model is truly **robust and reliable**.
